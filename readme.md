# VDLL 

### A minimal right-click video converter using FFMPEG 

why? because its convenient. most people don’t want to touch a command prompt, even if it takes two seconds.
so instead of using an ad-riddled online converter or having to spend hours re-exporting a file in your editor, just right-click your video and wait a few seconds.
